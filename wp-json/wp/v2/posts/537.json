E-commerce users rose to 150 million in 2019, from 49 million in 2015, while ridehailing active users rose soared nearly five times to 40 million in 2019, from 8 million in 2015.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">&ldquo;In the span of a few years, e-Commerce and Ride Hailing have become an integral part of daily life for millions of Southeast Asians, especially those living in big cities. They offer convenience, value and access to services and products that were previously difficult to obtain,&rdquo; the study said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Ridehailing, especially, is a big draw for people in crowded cities such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, where it&rsquo;s quite costly to own private vehicles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Food delivery apps, clubbed under these two umbrella categories, are also gaining momentum for the convenience they afford the rising middle class population.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">In e-commerce, users in the region turned&nbsp;to online shopping platforms not just for big-ticket items such as electronics, but also for lower-cost items such as groceries, personal items, clothing, subscription boxes etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Digital Payments on the Rise:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/2(1).jpg\" width=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">By 2025, for every $2 that is spent, almost $1 would be online, the study estimates. Today, most of the fintech platforms are geared towards digital payments, although other financial services are gaining traction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Online research for financial services is increasing too, even though most users still choose to buy financial products offline. In Singapore, 60 percent people and in Vietnam, 50 percent people wanting to buy financial services did research online. And around 72 percent in Indonesia used online gateways for information on loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Bridging the Communication Gap for Work and Play:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/3(1).jpg\" width=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">For productivity, users in Southeast Asia continued to trust Google Docs and sheets to enable efficient workflow, as well as collaborate with teammates across the world. People also used video apps to look for &lsquo;reviews&rsquo; of products and services, as well as for education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">To make communication easier in a region with at least 10 official languages, apps like Google Translate were critical. Ridehailing and travel apps employed Google Translate to enable communication in real time between users and service providers in the region.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Finding Your Way:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/bg%204.jpg\" width=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Apps that help users locate places and businesses, or suggest the best routes to destinations were widely used by Southeast Asians in 2019, the study showed. Waze, Google Maps were among the most used apps in this category, with users looking to them for real-time traffic updates, public transport schedules, and information&nbsp;such as location and opening hours, on small and medium-sized businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">The apps were also popularly used to check product reviews, booking services online, and searching for restaurants and hotels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Entertainment, Everywhere:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/gb5.jpg\" width=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Online media grew by almost four times in the last four years in Southeast Asia, to over $14 billion in 2019, and the sector is expected to grow to $32 billion by 2025, the research showed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Underpinning the boom in video and music streaming is the rise in new interest users in the region, as well as online advertising spend, which allows these services to expand rapidly into newer regions, and offer more variety of content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">According to Google Trends, queries for subscription video streaming brands like Hooq, iFlix, Netflix and Viu grew more than five times in Malaysia and seven times in the Philippines and Singapore over the last four years, hitting all-time peaks in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\">Short form videos have also become popular, leading to popularity of apps such as BIGO LIVE, and TikTok, as have mobile gaming platforms, such as Garena&rsquo;s Free Fire, which has over 50 million peak active users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>By:<\/strong><em><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><a data-ga-action=\"click\" data-ga-category=\"article.author\" data-ga-label=\"name\" href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/author\/aparajita-saxena\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Person\" rel=\"author\" title=\"Aparajita Saxena: Article Author\">Aparajita Saxena<\/a><\/em><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;\"><strong>Source<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/slideshow\/340356\"><em>https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/slideshow\/340356<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About 90 percent of the total internet users in Southeast Asia used their cell phones to log on to the web.&nbsp;
