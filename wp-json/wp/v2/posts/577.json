The agriculture sector has traditionally been associated with conventional characteristics, but the agricultural industry is not immune to the impact of the Information Technology 4.0 wave. IoT technology with factories, farms, and a smart agricultural ecosystem is one of the new technologies contributing to beneficial improvements in the agriculture business. Let\u2019s look at IoT\u2019s great solutions and benefits to this industry in this Rikkeisoft blog!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"409\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/211019%20-%20smartfarm-02.png\" width=\"1600\"><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ease of internet connectivity and cheap computing have made it possible to incorporate IoT solutions in farming. Here are some examples of how IoT can be used for the agriculture industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Precision Farming: Also known as precision agriculture, precision farming can be thought of as anything that makes farming practice more controlled and accurate when raising livestock and growing crops. This is one of the most famous applications of IoT in the agricultural sector, and numerous organizations are leveraging this technique around the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Monitoring of climate conditions: A climate change monitoring system integrates satellite observations, ground-based data, and forecast models to monitor and forecast changes in the weather and climate. Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e., precision farming).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smart Greenhouse automation: Greenhouse farming is a method of increasing agricultural, vegetable, and fruit yields. Greenhouses control environmental factors in one of two ways: manually or via a proportional control mechanism. Through IoT embedded systems, a smart greenhouse not only monitors but also manages the environment. As a result, there is no need for human intervention.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From 2019-2020, Rikkeisoft has developed the \u201cSmart Agriculture\u201d solution for our Japanese customers. Rikkeisoft has successfully constructed an IoT-applied smart technology system to meet client needs effectively by understanding customer requirements for developing an automated monitoring and control system for a greenhouse vegetable garden. Rikkeisoft is more confident in applying the extraordinary advances of IoT to its products after the first IoT achievements in the agriculture industry. In the future, our team will continue to research and improve products for use in the country&#8217;s agricultural business, thereby boosting the harvest quality for Vietnamese farmers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"617\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/211019%20-%20smartfarm-02-04.png\" width=\"1600\"><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-180ff46f-7fff-3389-c50c-dcacdc847069\">&nbsp;<\/b>The use of IoT in agriculture has the potential to transform humans and the world as a whole. We are currently witnessing how harsh weather, eroding soil, dry areas, and collapsing ecosystems are making food production increasingly difficult and costly. Here are several benefits that IoT brings to the development of agriculture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Data collection: All data can be collected using the sensors that have been installed. For example, Weather conditions, animal health, crop conditions, and so on are examples of such data. Therefore, farmers can simply review and analyze data in one spot to make the best decision possible.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Risk Reduction: When farmers understand what problems are happening with their production process, they can grasp the situation in the future and forecast some issues that may occur. Moreover, farmers also can use the collected data to increase the sale activities and improve their working process to save time and money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reduce Resources: Plenty of IoT solutions are focused on optimizing the use of resources\u2014water, energy, land. For example, precision farming, as mentioned above, using IoT relies on the data collected from various sensors in the field, which helps farmers accurately allocate just enough resources within one plant.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improve Product Quality: The application of IoT in agriculture can help farmers improve their product quality by using soil and crop sensors, aerial drone monitoring, and farm mapping. As a result, farmers better understand detailed dependencies between the conditions and the quality of the crops, which boosts the nutritional worth of the items by using connected systems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-180ff46f-7fff-3389-c50c-dcacdc847069\">Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, markets will grow and collapse, disruptive business models will emerge or die, but people will always need food and drink to maintain their life. For this reason, the development of such areas as food production and farming activities will always be a priority, especially given the dynamics we observe in the world today. Therefore, IoT used in agriculture has a promising future as a driving force of efficiency, sustainability, and scalability in this industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Rikkeisoft hopes you found these IoT solutions for Agriculture&nbsp;helpful for your company to apply.
