Additionally, the Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications states that although 50,000 developers graduate in Vietnam annually, 72% lack practical skills, 42% lack team skills, and 80% need additional training. These highlight the strict requirements facing the Vietnamese IT industry. Therefore, if they are to find work, students need specialized knowledge, soft skills, and practical application to meet these challenges. Yet because of this, an opportunity to enhance the educational value of these institutions is presented.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing these facts, Rikkeisoft, having overcome the year 2020, decided to mark 2021 with another step forward. Keeping in mind the goal of increasing the total number of employees to 10,000, we endeavored to build the future developers of Vietnam by directly supporting their education.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1036\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/image_2021_03_11T03_22_24_191Z.png\" width=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building a Dream Team of Top-Class Developers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/aptech2.jpg\" width=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>March 10, 2021, Hanoi <\/em>&#8211; Rikkeisoft signed a long-term partnership agreement with Aptech Polytechnic University. Over 70 guests, Aptech students, and organization directors attended the ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aptech Polytechnic, with its innovative inverse training model of &#39;Do First-Learn Later&#39;, has for many years trained and supplied human resources for the IT industry. Their hands-on model ensures students can find work immediately after graduation within their network of 200+ strategic partners.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rikkeisoft will participate in this network by supporting a new curriculum called &quot;<strong>Training IT Leaders 4.0<\/strong>&quot;. We will do this by letting students learn in an actual working environment, where they will get the opportunity to meet with real industry professionals. The conditions afforded by this will then lend students practical knowledge, experience, and understanding of the software development industry. Students will need to complete 1200 hours of practice and 900 hours of lectures to finish the program.&nbsp;Rikkeisoft will support this by bringing the best equipment and staff available for students to get an insider&#39;s look at the industry. They will get to speak with experienced engineers, learn what to expect when going into a project, and, as proof of their qualifications upon completing the course, the ability to personally meet industry employers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Nguyen Viet Lam, Rikkeisoft&#39;s representative at the ceremony, had this to say: &quot;For the Vietnamese IT industry, there is a large number of people but a lack of highly qualified personnel. This leads to a shortage of quality human resources. Rikkeisoft hopes that this cooperation will bring benefit to both parties in the common goal of giving young talents a bright path to development and becoming Vietnamese IT stars.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/157748242_3883663325052987_342993725108547465_o.jpg\" width=\"800\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Within this framework, Rikkeisoft-brand courses and exchanges will supplement the student&#39;s education, which will go a long way toward creating recruitment opportunities among Vietnam&#39;s future IT developers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Nguyen Duy Quang, Aptech Polytechnic&#39;s Director, wished Rikkeisoft and other partners the best in creating a high-quality training program for their students.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/DSC_6200.jpg\" width=\"806\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With luck, this long-term partnership will profit both Rikkeisoft and Aptech Polytechnic, thanks to the strides made together in training, developing, and supplying high-quality IT human resources.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new recruitment strategy for 2021 &nbsp; Human resources is a hotly debated subject within Vietnamese business, particularly among Vietnamese IT professionals.&nbsp; &nbsp; According to forecasts, Vietnam will lack 900,000 IT professionals for the years 2020 and 2021.
