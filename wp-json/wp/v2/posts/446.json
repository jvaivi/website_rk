A rising middle class, growing internet usage, and a young population present a great combination for the fintech sector to thrive. An estimated 120 companies and brands cover a wide range of services, from digital payments to wealth management and blockchain.<\/big><\/small><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vietnam-briefing.com\/news\/vietnams-payment-preferences-4-trends-watch.html\/\">Digital payments<\/a> is the most popular segment, with mobile payment apps MoMo, Moca, and Zalo Pay leading the way. Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) is also becoming increasingly popular, with Tima, Growth Wealth, and Trust Circle among the most popular.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency is the third segment in this sector that is increasingly gaining traction. Several companies like TomoChain and Kyber Network deal in cryptocurrency, allowing consumers faster and cheaper transactions.

While still developing, AI in the country has followed global trends in application to human resources, education, healthcare, agriculture, transport, and e-commerce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A good example of how AI is being used domestically can be found in an one of the leading IT companies in Vietnam RIKKEISOFT , which has established its affliated company RIKKEI.AI to research and implement various projects applied AI. RIKKEI.AI has used AI in solving the problem of traffic jam, helping the disabled people, as well as contributing to E-government with Chatbot, Peeling tape.<br \/>\nIn August, the government issued <em>Resolution No.50-NQ-TW,<\/em> encouraging FDI by increasing the number of businesses to 50 percent by 2025 in advanced technology and Industry 4.0 &ndash; this could help develop AI further.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>E-Commerce<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"630\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/20407_20407_Tiki-Sendo_sapnhap_thuongmaidientu_Ava_2.jpg\" width=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Vietnam&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vietnam-briefing.com\/news\/amazon-enter-vietnams-growing-e-commerce-market.html\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-commerce market<\/a> could be ranked third after Indonesia and Thailand by 2025, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1i-KZhYgwSb4WIadjwj4hvpj8V-jYrTrU\/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">E-Business Index 2019<\/a> report by the Vietnam E-Commerce Association.<br \/>\nVietnam&rsquo;s e-commerce activity is most active in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vietnam-briefing.com\/news\/hanoi-vietnams-leading-fdi-destination.html\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hanoi<\/a> and Ho Chi Minh City. However, developement and logistics costs remain challenges for e-commerce companies in the country. That&#39;s why most Vietnamese corporations choose the third party &#8211; IT Outsourcing Company which can help them build e-commerce sits without spending large amount of money and effort. Over the last four years, RIKKEISOFT has gained trust and reliability from big corporations in building E-commerce sites, AWS E-commerce integration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Software Outsourcing<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nSoftware outsourcing has gained traction over the last decade in Vietnam. According to a survey by US-based software vendor BetterCloud, 73 percent of organizations will use software outsourcing.Vietnam has emerged as a cheaper outsourcing destination compared to traditional markets, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.china-briefing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">China<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.india-briefing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">India<\/a>. This helped the software industry reach revenues of US$8.8 billion in 2018, according to the Vietnam Software and IT Services Association.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/IMG_0740.jpg\" width=\"584\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The government is developing high-tech parks and is also offering several incentives to further the industry. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vietnam-briefing.com\/news\/da-nang-emerging-southeast-asias-next-startup-hub.html\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Da Nang<\/a> has developed as a software outsourcing center, particularly for Japanese businesses. Recognizing the market&#39;s demand, <strong>RIKKEISOFT<\/strong> has already expanded its branches to DaNang since 2016. The international enterprises are now easily accessing to RIKKEISOFT&#39;s services in Hanoi, Hochiminh city, and Danang as well. In the near future, we are planning to expand our business to all the cities of Vietnam.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Education Technology<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Vietnam&rsquo;s education technology (Edtech) has received investments worth US$55 million in 2018. This investment is largely driven by Edtech centers&rsquo; ability to bridge the gap between traditional education environments and learning needs inspired by the private sector.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Vietnamese startup Everest Education secured a US$4 million investment by a Hong Kong-based equity firm. Organizations like Everest Education provide tech-enabled personal learning through a network of centers and partner schools.<\/p>\n<p>Vietnam&rsquo;s kindergarten through grade 12 population is a large market with locals spending up to 40 percent of their disposable income on education. It&rsquo;s no surprise that foreign investors from Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Australia are showing interest.<\/p>\n<p>Still, challenges exist, and Vietnam needs to develop large scale IT outsourcing to compete with global players. In addition, more attention will be needed to improve English speaking skills to cater to global firms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><strong>Strong growth trajectory, supported by government <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The government prioritizes investment in IT and incentivizes investment in this space.
