Though it started out with promise, the Covid-19 pandemic forced us all to change our plans, leaving us with a year like no other. However, despite all the hardship, we were able to overcome and make a lot of happy memories that we&rsquo;ll be able to take with us into the new year. As such, we&rsquo;d like to take this final moment to thank our loyal customers and employees for their support and reflect on some of the milestones we achieved this year.<\/p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>1. We opened an office in Osaka<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We started the year on a positive note, moving into the vibrant downtown area of Chaya-machi. Opening a second Japanese office was no small feat, so we commemorated getting started in our fifth city by having a party at the InterContinental Osaka hotel. Led by Managing Director, Nakamura Keisuke, our Osaka office has already shown great signs of success and is expected to continue doing so as we move into the next year.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1104\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/Osara%20branch(1).jpg\" width=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>2. Rikkeisoft anti-pandemic measures were a success!<\/strong><\/span><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were all forced into lockdown by the Covid-19, but that didn&rsquo;t stop us from continuing to deliver quality products for all of our customers. Even while we were working from home, and especially during the second wave, we made extra sure to keep delivering on our promises, all while making sure we complied with social distancing. As a result, we were able to keep business running as usual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/1596683150573.jpg\" width=\"900\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>3. Rikkeisoft set a new mission, vision, and core values!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had to change ourselves, to not only deliver quality products to our partners, but also to do our part to build a better society. We decided to change ourselves to better take on new global markets! Aspiration, Improvement, Dedication, Innovation, Openness&hellip; These values will no doubt serve us well as we Raise Vietnamese Value and aim for the top spot in the world of Vietnamese technology.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"901\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/Core%20value.jpg\" width=\"901\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>4.&nbsp;We raised 3 million USD in capital and transitioned from a privately-held limited company into a joint stock-held corporation<\/strong><\/span><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we started in 2012, we were just six friends working together in one cramped apartment. Now that we&#39;d grown to a company of 1,200+, we needed to restructure ourselves to better function in the rapidly changing world of enterprises. In Vietnam, only a few local companies have the size necessary to call themselves a corporation and we are proud to be included on this exclusive list.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"721\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/corporation.jpg\" width=\"1280\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>5.&nbsp;We donated computers and rebuilt schools for minority communities!<\/strong><\/span><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our company ventured into the border regions to do our part to Raise Vietnamese Value. For example, in the storm-affected province of Quang Nam, we raised 400 million VND to help the local schools and towns get back on their feet. Not hoping to leave the people of Dien Bien out, we went to their province to donate computers, bringing them firmly into the 21st century. This isn&rsquo;t to forget, finally, our trip to Ha Giang where we inaugurated a new school, which will help keep the children warm as they study in the cold winter months.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" height=\"900\" src=\"https:\/\/rikkeisoft.com\/wp-content\/themes\/main\/assets\/ckfinder\/images\/charity%203.JPG\" width=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>6.&nbsp;We signed a strategic partnership with Oraichain!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We secured the chance of a lifetime, when we signed up with the world&rsquo;s first AI-powered Data Oracle Platform!
